# stockNote Backend (investments-research-platform)

## stockNote is an amateur stocks and shares research platform where a user can:

- create an authenticated user profile
- add stocks to their watchlist
- get news on their selected stocks
- see stock price data for the last year (US stocks only) + a link out to Google Finance for more complete data. 
- add notes / comments to their stocks so that a user can keep track of their thoughts and analysis
- send themselves the notes by email now or at ata future date of their choosing.


Backend is built using Ruby on Rails (and is hosted on Heroku).
APIs for news data and stock data comes from newsapi.org and iextrading respectively. 
Email notifcations done through ActionMailer and ActiveJobs using SideKiq and Retis.

### Stock specific page - line chart
![Alt text](images/viewChart.png)
The stock data chart comes from the IEX trading data API (for US stocks only). This uses a stock ticker and is why the user must enter a stock ticker when adding a new stock. 
The line chart is created using the React Chart js library. 

----------------------------------------------------
The app is live at http://stock-note.surge.sh/ with the backend hosted on Heroku. Upon arrival, the server may take a few seconds to post news onto the homepage. At this point, one can create an account and add stocks.

NOTE: The deployment to production has a few bugs and I am working through these.
